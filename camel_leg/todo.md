**TODO**


- Improve training process - why does it always roll - bad selection, more direct training? directly punish, assimilate monte carlo training???
- Evaluate monte carlo like simulation vs exact calculation | all possible game statesish approach
- Make UI more bloglike, cleaner interface etc., ability to roll and jump into the game, run model evaluations inside brower interface
- Look at other approaches Sir...
